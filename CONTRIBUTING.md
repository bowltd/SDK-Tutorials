## How to Contribute

Contributions can take many forms, from writing documentation, reporting bugs, and submitting feature requests, to writing code which can be incorporated into the project itself. Here are some ways you can contribute:

### Reporting Bugs

Bugs are reported via issues on our GitHub repository. When reporting a bug, please include:

- A clear and descriptive title.
- A concise description of the problem.
- Steps to reproduce the issue.
- Expected behavior and what occurred instead.
- Any relevant logs or error messages.

### Feature Requests

Feature requests are also welcome. Please:

- Provide a clear and descriptive title.
- Include a detailed description of the proposed feature and its benefits.
- Discuss its relevance and how it fits into the project's objectives.

### Pull Requests

We actively welcome your pull requests. If you've improved a feature or resolved a bug, you can submit a pull request using the following steps:

1. Fork the repository and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code, update the documentation accordingly.
3. Ensure your code adheres to the existing style to maintain consistency.
4. Write meaningful commit messages.
5. Include any relevant test results to show how you have tested your changes.
6. Submit a pull request.

## Styleguides
