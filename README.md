# BOW SDK Tutorials Repository

Welcome to the BOW SDK Tutorials repository. This repository contains tutorial projects demonstrating the use of the BOW SDK across various programming languages and operating systems. The tutorials cover an ever-increasing range of topics.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into 2 sections, examples and tutorials:

- Tutorials are step by step guides, each focusing on a specific aspect of using the BOW SDK or answering a common question in robotics. A breakdown of these tutorials can be found on our [tutorials documentation page](https://docs.bow.software/tutorials)

- Examples are designed to showcase some complete applications which combine multiple elements from the tutorials and demonstrate how you can integrate external applications and programs with BOW to bring your robots alive. A breakdown of these tutorials can be found on our [tutorials documentation page](https://docs.bow.software/tutorials#examples)

 
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Git installed on your system to clone the repository. Depending on the programming language you choose, specific tools and environments will be required:

- **C++**: GCC or MSVC, CMake
- **.NET**: .NET SDK
- **Python**: Python 3.7 or higher

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bowltd/SDK-Tutorials.git
cd SDK-Tutorials
```

### Usage

#### Starting Point

Navigate to the `Tutorials/basics/Step_0_Dependencies` directory
to set up the necessary environment for your chosen language and operating system.

#### Explore

After setting up the dependencies,
feel free to explore the tutorials in order or go directly to the one that is the most interesting. 

Every tutorial contains its own README describing a different aspect of the BOW SDK and how it can be used. 

Within every tutorial, you will find subfolders implementing that specific aspect using different programming languages.
