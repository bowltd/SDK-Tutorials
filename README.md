# BOW SDK Tutorials Repository

Welcome to the BOW SDK Tutorials repository. This repository contains tutorial projects demonstrating the use of the BOW SDK across various programming languages and operating systems. The tutorials cover an ever-increasing range of topics.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into different steps, each focusing on a specific aspect of using the BOW SDK:

- `Step_0_Dependencies`: Scripts and instructions for setting up necessary dependencies needed for the tutorials based on your operating system and programming language.
- `Step_1_Vision`: Sample applications demonstrating sampling and visualization of images coming from Vision Modality.
- `Step_2_Locomotion`: Sample applications combining sampling images from the Vision Modality with controlling Locomotion via the Motor Modality to navigate an environment.
- `Step_3_Inverse_Kinematics`: Sample applications combining earlier the earlier locomotion step with inverse kinematics
- `Step_4_Direct_Joint_Control`: Sample applications showing how to directly control joint angles with BOW
- `Step_5_Multi_Robot_Control`: Sample applications showing how direct multiple robots at once.
- `Step_6_Speech`: Sample applications showing how to use Audio with BOW
  
## Getting Started
